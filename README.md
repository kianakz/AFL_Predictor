This project analyses the AFL data provided in the "RawData.csv" file, and predicts the Brownlow votes that each player receives in each game. To acheive this, it first preproccesses the data and split the raw data into training set, cross validation set and test set. Afterwards, it trains 3 diffrent machine learning models using our training set: Logistic regression, Neural networks and Decision trees. 
Then, it evaluates the accuracy of the models using the cross validation set.
